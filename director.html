        <div class="director_set">Christopher <br>Edward Nolan</div>
        <div class="director_txt">Christopher Edward Nolan CBE (/ˈnoʊlən/; born 30 July 1970) is a British-American film 
            director, producer and screenwriter known for making personal, distinctive films within 
            the Hollywood mainstream. His directorial efforts have grossed more than US$5 billion 
            worldwide, garnered 34 Oscar nominations and ten wins.

            Nolan's films are typically rooted in epistemological and metaphysical themes, 
            exploring human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory 
            and personal identity. His work is permeated by mathematically inspired images and concepts, 
            unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, 
            large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of 
            his films with his brother Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his 
            wife Emma Thomas.</div>
